My term project is called “Fighting Irish World.” It is a single player game similar to Super Mario Bros. Players will select one of three maps. They will then try to evade or kill enemies, on the way to the finish line on the right side of the map. A score will then be given based on how many enemies the player killed. Players have three lives and if an enemy sprite touches the player through the player’s side, they will lose one of their three lives. If the player touches the enemy through the enemy’s top side, the enemy will die. Collecting clovers will give the player an extra life up to a max of three lives. Player’s can double jump and scale walls.

First of all, the user should make sure they have VS Code and CMU graphics installed. Use the link here to get directions on how to download VS Code. Then, follow the directions here to install CMU graphics. After that, there isn’t much more the user must do to set up. The file containing the project should contain all the classes and maps, which are stored in csv files. There should also be a folder containing the images used in the project. All the user must do to run the project is to open and run the file called “main_app.py”.

The only library that needs to be installed is the CMU graphics library; the directions for that are listed above. Other than that, there is no library the user needs to install before hand.

The project does not have any shortcut commands. The user simply uses the arrow keys to move.

My project does not use any fonts that need to be installed.
